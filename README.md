What did you build?
I built a basic choose your own adventure type game.

What language(s) or tools did you use?
I used Java with the help of intellije

Which AI tools did you use, and how?
Gemini and Chat GPT to build the foundation of code, for the if else statements.

What did you do versus what AI helped with?
The AI set a foundation of what the code looked like, creating the try except, and if else statements for a basic pick your own adventure game.
I mainly added some more if else statements, changed up the story to be more... meme like, added multiple songs and sound files from my favorite playlists, got rid of the comvoluted try except catches they did cause it was bad, and instead gives them an automatic game over if they dare choose an option I havent given them hehehe

What’s one thing you’re proud of?
Adding my songs to this, it was so funny LOL

What’s one thing you’d improve with more time?
If I had more time, id definetley add more story to this short adventure and way way more songs.
